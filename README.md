# Installation

1. Install Mallet machine learning language toolkit  
2. Install GNU Trove high performance collections for Java
3. Install Deep cloner for Java from: https://github.com/kostaskougios/cloning

# Runtime Instructions

Run `Main.java` to run the simulated annealing algorithm on the Carnivora dataset. For other dataset and hyperparameter combinations, change the corresponding variables in `Main.java`.

# TODO

The following updates to the repository are forthcoming:
- Friendly command line interface for dataset and hyperparameter input
- More thorough documentation of installation and runtime instructions
